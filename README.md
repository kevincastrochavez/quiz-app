# Overview

I'm trying to learn a new language or technology every two weeks to further my learning and this time I worked with Kotlin

I created a Quiz App that has three screens: the first one is a Welcome screen where you have to ener your name, the second one is to respond questions about what country belongs to the flag displayed, and the third one is a results screen, showing you how many answers you got right

The purpose of my application is to learn the fundamentals of Kotlin, data classes, collections and UI components

# Development Environment

I used Android Studio to create my Kotlin app

Kotlin is a multiplatform mobile language (shares the logic of your Android and iOS apps while keeping the UX native). It's safe and concise and is used by 60% of android developers

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* Add functionality of not being able to click a new answer when you got it wrong
* If no answer was selected, button cannot be clicked
* Add feature of being able to add different quizzed with their corresponding questions
